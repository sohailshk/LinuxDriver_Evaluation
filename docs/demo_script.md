## ðŸŽ¬ DEMO SCRIPT

### **[0:00-0:15] Introduction**
**Say:** "Hi, I'm presenting the Linux Device Driver Evaluation Framework - an automated system that benchmarks AI models on their ability to generate high-quality Linux device drivers."

**Show:** Project directory structure
```bash
ls -la
```

**Key Point:** "This framework evaluates AI-generated code across multiple dimensions: compilation, style, functionality, and security."

---

### **[0:15-0:45] Framework Overview**
**Say:** "Let me show you how this works. We have a sample device driver that we'll evaluate step by step."

**Show:** The source code
```bash
cat src/hello_world.c | head -20
```

**Key Point:** "This is a character device driver with read/write operations - exactly what AI models need to generate."

---

### **[0:45-1:30] Step 1: Compilation & Static Analysis**
**Say:** "First, we test compilation and run static analysis tools like checkpatch.pl for Linux kernel style compliance."

**Run:**
```bash
./scripts/evaluate_compile_clean.sh
```

**Key Point:** "Notice we reduced violations from 138 to just 3 - that's a 97% improvement in code quality!"

**Show results:**
```bash
python3 scripts/compile_analyzer.py
```

**Key Point:** "Static analysis score: 4/10 (40%) - room for improvement but functional."

---

### **[1:30-2:00] Step 2: Functional Testing**
**Say:** "Now we test if the driver actually works - can it load, create device nodes, and handle I/O operations."

**Run:**
```bash
make clean && make hello
sudo python3 tests/test_driver.py
```

**Key Point:** "5 out of 7 tests passed (71%) - the framework correctly identifies WSL2 limitations while testing device functionality."

---

### **[2:00-2:30] Step 3: Comprehensive Reporting**
**Say:** "Finally, we generate professional reports with detailed scoring and recommendations."

**Run:**
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_report.py --format html
```

**Show:** Open the HTML report in browser
**Key Point:** "Overall score: 53.7/100 with specific recommendations for improvement."

---

### **[2:30-3:00] Conclusion**
**Say:** "This framework provides comprehensive evaluation of AI-generated Linux drivers with:"

**Show:** Final report summary
- âœ… Automated compilation testing
- âœ… Linux kernel style compliance
- âœ… Functional device driver testing
- âœ… Professional reporting with actionable feedback

**Key Point:** "Perfect for benchmarking AI models on complex system programming tasks."
